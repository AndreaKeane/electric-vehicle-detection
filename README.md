# Electric Vehicle Detection  


Given a series of power readings for a house or set of houses, the fitted binary classifiers predict:  
A. Does the house have an EV?   
B. For a given time interval, was an EV charging?

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).

2. Raw data was provided by GridCure and is deliberately excluded from this repository. Interim data structures and final models are available on request. 
    
3. Part A data processing/transformation scripts are kept [here](https://github.com/AndreaKeane/electric-vehicle-detection/tree/master/part_a)  

4. Part B data processing/transformation scripts are kept [here](https://github.com/AndreaKeane/electric-vehicle-detection/tree/master/part_b)

5. Applying the model on a final test set and results are kept [here](https://github.com/AndreaKeane/electric-vehicle-detection/tree/master/final_test)

6. The report with full model development process and analysis is in XXX.
